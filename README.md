# InstructPermissions
A simple module written for [Instructability](https://github.com/Kaioru/Instructability) for [Discord4J](https://austinv11.github.io/Discord4J/)

This module reads and saves the permission registry. Saves are done every 60 seconds.
## How to install
### Step 1: Downloading required libraries
Luckily for you, InstructPermissions only requires Instructability v0.2.0 (minimum) to run.
### Step 2: Place in modules folder
Then, place the 'InstructPermissions' and 'Instructability' jar files in your modules directory or as required by your bot. Discord4J will load them automagically and ExtendedInstructs is now installed, woo!
